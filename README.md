#### mapalive

A little map of some pretty places in the area where I grew up!

After loading the index.html you can search for the places in the search bar (through names or keywords, that fit its description), or chose one from the list.
When using the searchbar, a list of words taken from the descriptions gets presented too, giving the chance to choose a place according to keywords, there is also a super confusing autocomplete functionality.

Choose an activity and see where you can do it!

If you want extra info about a place click the marker.

The app dynamically updates the photos that fit the search or click parameters.

The app also display the current weather and temperature!

It also tells you weather you are the only one exploring the app or if other people are onlie with you (or if you have multiple browser windows opened).
